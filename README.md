# Issues
1. React warning after adding Post card: (findDOMNode is deprecated in StrictMode. findDOMNode was passed an instance of RefFindNode which is inside StrictMode. Instead, add a ref directly to the element you want to reference.) (fixed)
2. After register the menu stays highlighted at Register instead of Home (fixed)
3. Updating apollo client cache and rewriting query does not update home page posts (fixed)
4. Same issue persists with deletePost mutation also, not just createPost mutation (fixed)
5. Senmatic UI Popup not working in production
